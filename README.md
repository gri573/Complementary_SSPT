# Complementary_SSPT
Complementary shaders by EminGT, based on BSL shaders by Capt Tatsu, with SSPT added by gri573

<br/>
<br/>

This project is currently very experimental, errors and incompatibilities are to be expected. While bug reports are appreciated, reported bugs may not be fixed while the initial implementation is unfinished.
