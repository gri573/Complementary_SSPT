# Complementary_SSPT
Complementary shaders by EminGT, based on BSL shaders by Capt Tatsu, with SSPT added by gri573


This project is currently very experimental, errors and incompatibilities are to be expected. While bug reports are appreciated, reported bugs may not be fixed while the initial implementation is unfinished.

using a PBR resource pack with texture based emissive support is recommended.
